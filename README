All test files have to be put under store/input. When testing, open a web frontend, 
enter all the inputs (please use input as input Directory), as well as the other arguments. 
When multiple workers run on the job, the same file will be generated. 

Right now, the input has all three texting files given by the professor. Class Name of the job
shouldn't be changed, and it can currently take only edu.upenn.cis455.mapreduce.job.MyJob OR
edu.upenn.cis455.mapreduce.job.WordCount. If you would like to test different name, you got to 
create a new class with the name of your new entered class name, and copy&paste the map&reduce 
function into your new class.  

This is what I can get when I test my program. If you are unable to get the same result, please
let me know ASAP. As of April 18th, the TA informed me that grading rubric hasn't been finalized yet, 
so please let me know if you have to use a completely different method to test my program.
